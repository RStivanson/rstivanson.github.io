This algorithm likes to produce long winding tunnels and forks. There are still plenty of stubs and dead ends as well. With such long tunnels it seems to be harder to find where the given tunnel ends. This algorithm behaves like a recursive backtracker due to the Hunt portion extending from already visited cells, however it is not a backtracker because it does not actually backtrack.",
